# DJ Wazuh Incident & Detection Case Studies

This repository documents my ongoing journey running and maturing my **home SOC environment** using Wazuh.  
Rather than treating my lab as a “toy,” I operate it the way a real SOC would: continuously tuning detections, validating signals, analyzing security telemetry, and documenting investigations in a professional, DFIR-style format.

Each incident report in this repo follows a structured SOC workflow, including:
- Executive summary
- Timeline of events
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping & interpretation
- Detection accuracy validation
- AI-assisted threat classification
- SOC / DFIR analyst narrative
- Recommended response actions
- Lessons learned

These reports reflect the same type of work analysts perform in professional environments — but driven through hands-on learning, curiosity, and continuous improvement.
